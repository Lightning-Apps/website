    <h4>What is it?</h4>
    <p>Roadhouse Finder is my all new app made for German highways. The idea: There are quite many roadhouses
        located at several highways with all kinds of restaurants, gas stations, cafés and more.
        But one thing is missing: knowing whats where. You may find a desired café on Maps, but that mostly just
        works for a specific search.
        Roadhouse Finder fixes exactly that problem. It's a map focussed on the German roadhouses and lets you find
        what you're looking for quickly.</p>

    <h4>When will it be available?</h4>
    <p>Currently the progress on the app is slower than anticipated.
        I currently aim to release in Spring 2025, more on that in the future.
